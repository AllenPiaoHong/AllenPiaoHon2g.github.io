My name is Wang Piaohong ("王飘鸿" in Chinese). I am a second-year HCI Ph.D. student at the City University of Hong Kong. 
My supervisor is [Prof. Zhicong Lu](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/), the Chair of the Asia SIGCHI Committee (亚洲人机交互理事会主席). 
My research interests primarily revolve around exploring how novel interfaces can enhance people's well-being in their daily lives. 
Additionally, I am also interested in employing the HCI perspective to study users on emerging platforms. I focus on how digital platforms 
can improve people’s real-life well-being.
